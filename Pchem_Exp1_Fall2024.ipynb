        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of a physical chemistry experiment is to measure an interesting chemical or physical property of a chemical system. This property most often emphasized in a one semester physical chemistry course (e.g., BCH/CHM 341) is thermodynamically relavent, for example the heat capacity, enthalpy, entropy, rate constant, or activation energy. In reporting the results of experiments it is extremely important to quantify the accuracy of the measurements. Errors are inevitable in experiments; however, they can be hard to work out. This is especially true when complex ﬁtting functions are used to analyze the data, or when the data are compared to simulations. Nevertheless, a good analysis of errors can elevate the quality of your paper and help convince readers that the data have been carefully analyzed and are reliable. The goal of this exercise is to provide a basic practical guide for data and error analysis in physical chemistry experiments. Unlike experiments in biological sciences which involve controls and sometimes complex hypothesis testing, errors in physical chemistry are relatively straightforward. There are two common situations: (i) the case where a series of experimental measurements are averaged together to determine an expectation value and (ii) curve ﬁtting where experimental data are ﬁt to a function. In both cases the goal is to provide a best estimate for the quantity being measured, as well as an estimate of the range of possible values. This discussion will assume that we are only dealing with random errors; that is, that there are no systematic errors in the measurements.  There are numerous resources that cover data and error analysis in detail [1-4], including a colab (and pdf) overview written specifically to help students in ASU CHM 343.\n",
        "\n",
        "To emphasize the importance of data and error analysis, experimental and computational data will be provided to students and the focus will be completely on the treatment, visualization and reporting of experimental and computational data. The data provided was acquired from the remotely accessible acoustic interferometer instrument that students use in the next lab (experiment 2). Multiple experimental measurements of the temperature and acoustic interferometry spectra of Argon gas were acquired and saved in ascii formatted files.  The data is available on the remote acoustic interferometer instrument computer and uploaded to the CHM343 Github repository, where it can be publicly accessed. From the multiple experimental measurements of the Argon gas temperature, determine the mean Argon gas temperature and the associated uncertainty. Report the mean value as T = (##.## $\\pm$ #.##)$^o$C. From the multiple acoustic interferometry spectral data of Argon gas, determine the mean length (L) of the acoustic interferometer tube and the associated uncertainty. Report the mean value as L = (###.## $\\pm$ #.##) mm.  To simplify data analysis of spectral data, the resonance frequencies for the first 15 nodes have been determined and saved in ascii csv format.\n",
        "\n",
        "Students should create a colab notebook for performing the data and error analysis as well as reporting the results.  There are several resources that cover jupyter (colab) notebooks and basic python [5-6], including tutorials provided on the [CHM343 Data GitHub repository](https://github.com/CHM343/Data).  Students are also provided with a colab template notebook and this document is a colab notebook along with most documents provided to students (and can serve as good examples).\n",

Since this is the next experiment in this laboratory course, there is significant background information in the experiment 2 module.  However, the basics can be quickly reviewed using the following reference: [\"Determining the Speed of Sound and Heat Capacity Ratios of Gases by Acoustic Interferometry,\" Varberg, T.D., et al., Journal of Chemical Education, 2017, 94(12), 1995–1998](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00526) (specifically, figure 2 and equation 6), which states\n",

        "where $\\nu$ is the resonance frequency, $c$ is the sound velocity, $L$ is the length of the cavity (tube), and $n$ is called the order or node number ($n = 1, 2, 3, ...$).  Argon gas is used to determine the length of the cavity because it has a very well-known sound velocity ($c_{Ar} (20^oC) = 319 m/s$)."
